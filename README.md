## William Russell - Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website. I used the static-site-generator Jekyll to create this webpage and host for free with Github pages. I will update this page over time as my portfolio builds. 

If you are interested in building a similar portfolio, I used [this](https://github.com/evanca/quick-portfolio) workspace as my template.

## Summer Research: Fission Simulator

**Project description:** Hired as a research assistant by Assistant professor Brian Kiedrowski for the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Michigan, I was placed on a small team tasked with simulating spontaneous nuclear fission. Our team built a command line C++ simulation using an existing code base as our starting point. Over the course of the summer, we developed a modular, object-oriented program that could efficiently simualate millions of fission events using multithreading to improve the program's speed. Our program could then output the results to the user or pass the results as an object to different programs for further use.

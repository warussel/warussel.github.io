### About

As a computer science student, I study software engineering / software development. I am particularly interested in Machine Learning, Computer Security and Web. When I am not coding, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, and occasionally playing Dungeons and Dragons. 

I have previous programming experience from my coursework, my personal projects, and from my time as a research assistant. I have also worked as an Orientation Leader for the Office of New Student Programs at the University of Michigan and as a peer mentor in the Michigan Community Scholars Program. After graduating highschool, I spent a year teaching English as a second language near Barcelona in Spain.

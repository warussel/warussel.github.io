## Intro to Computer Organization: LC-2K Simulator

**Project description:** The course intro to computer organization allowed me to gain introductory experience in computer architecture principals. For this course, the primary project was the simulation of a fictitious Little Computer 2000 (LC-2K). The project started with a working compiler to convert assembly code to machine code, and a simple single cycle processor to execute programs. A linker/loader was then added to the compiler, and the processor was updated with a pipelined, multi-cycle implementation. In addition, a working cache and a simple virtual memory were added to the processor towards the end of the course, and the resulting machine was used to execute simple programs such as a recursive factorial function.
